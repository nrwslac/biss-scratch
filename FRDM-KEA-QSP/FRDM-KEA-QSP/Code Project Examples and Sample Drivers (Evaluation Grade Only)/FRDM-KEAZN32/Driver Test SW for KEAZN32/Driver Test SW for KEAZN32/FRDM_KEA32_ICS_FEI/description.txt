*Setup internal clock source in FLL Engaged Internal (FEI)
*By default KEA32 internal reference clock is trimmed at 32 KHz
*This example sets a bus clock of 16.384 MHz using internal reference clock
*Bus clock frequency will output on PTH2 at 16.384MHz/128= 128 KHz
*Measure the freq on PTH2 using FTM2 CH0 (PTC0) in Dual Edge Capture mode, it will be 128 kHz
*FTM2 captures both rising/falling edge of the input waveform.
